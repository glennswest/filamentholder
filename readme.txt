A Filament Spool holder designed for desktop.

Took http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:272532 and reduced the height of the
handle and printed it in black abs. Used small bearing to hold the full size 
bearings in place in my remix.

Print qty 1 each of plate1.stl,plate2.stl,plate3.stl,plate4.stl.
Use a drill, and drill for m3 holes. Note the m3 screws need to be snug.

14 m3x10 screws (What I had)
4 #608 Skate bearings

Slide Bearings on posts, use the printed caps, or small bearings to hold the #608 in place. m3 screw to to hold bearings, and mount frame togeather.
